Permission Schema

Overview

The Permission schema defines individual permissions, their relationships, and requirements.

Schema Location

· File: schemas/permission.schema.yaml
· JSON Schema ID: https://github.com/RickCreator87/richards-credit-authority/schemas/permission.schema.yaml

Structure

```yaml
permission_id: string(pattern)          # Pattern: ^perm_[a-z_]+$
category: string(enum)                  # Permission category
name: string                            # Human-readable name
description: string                     # Detailed description
risk_level: string(enum)                # Risk assessment
prerequisites: array(string)            # Required permissions
conflicts_with: array(string)           # Conflicting permissions
validation_rules: object                # Usage rules
escalation_path: object                 # Escalation requirements

```

Risk Levels

Level Approval Required Audit Frequency Impact
low Automated Quarterly Minimal
medium Supervisor Monthly Moderate
high Manager + Compliance Weekly Significant
critical Director + Legal Daily Major

Validation Rules

```yaml
validation_rules:
  requires_approval: boolean            # Manual approval required
  minimum_verification_level: string    # Required identity verification
  maximum_frequency:
    count: integer                      # Max operations
    period: string                      # Time period (minute, hour, day, etc.)
```

Example

```yaml
permission_id: "perm_issue_credit"
category: "credit_operations"
name: "Issue Credit"
description: "Allows issuing new credit lines to verified identities"
risk_level: "high"
prerequisites:
  - "perm_view_credit_summary"
  - "perm_create_request"
validation_rules:
  requires_approval: true
  minimum_verification_level: "kyc_compliant"
escalation_path:

```

Tax Schema

Overview

The Tax schema defines tax jurisdictions, rates, and calculation rules.

Schema Location

Structure

```yaml
jurisdiction_code: string(pattern)      # Pattern: ^[A-Z]{2}(-[A-Z0-9]+)?$
jurisdiction_name: string               # Human-readable name
jurisdiction_type: string(enum)         # Federal, state, etc.
effective_date: string(date)            # Rule effective date
expiration_date: string(date)           # Rule expiration date
tax_rates: array                        # Tax rate definitions
reporting_requirements: object          # Reporting rules
withholding_rules: object               # Withholding requirements
compliance_rules: object                # Compliance requirements
reciprocity_agreements: array           # Inter-jurisdiction agreements
calculation_engine: object              # Calculation methods

Tax Rate Definitions

```yaml

    rate_type: "flat"                   # flat, graduated, marginal
    brackets:                           # For graduated rates
      - min_amount: 0
        max_amount: 11000
        rate: 10
    applies_to: ["individuals"]         # Applicable entities
```

Tax Types

reporting_requirements:
  forms:
    - form_code: "1040"
      frequency: "annually"
      due_date: "04-15"
```

Validation Rules

Cross-Schema Validation

The system enforces relationships between schemas:

1. Identity → Authority: Authority type must be compatible with identity type
2. Authority → Permission: Permissions must be valid and prerequisites satisfied
3. Tax → Jurisdiction: Tax calculations must use valid jurisdiction codes

Business Logic Rules

Identity Validation

· Individuals must be at least 18 years old (for credit issuance)
· Business entities must have valid tax IDs
· Government IDs must not be expired

Authority Validation

· Credit issuance limits must be reasonable for verification level
· Delegation chains cannot exceed 3 levels
· Geographic restrictions must be valid ISO codes

Tax Validation

· Withholding required for US jurisdiction payments over $600
· Proper forms required based on payment type and amount
· State tax calculations must consider reciprocity agreements

Custom Validation

You can extend validation by creating custom validators:

```python
from validation.validate_identity import IdentityValidator

class CustomIdentityValidator(IdentityValidator):
    def _validate_custom_rule(self, data):
        # Your custom validation logic
        pass
```
