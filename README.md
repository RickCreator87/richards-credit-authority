## 📌 Overview
The **Richards Credit Authority (RCA)** is a centralized governance repository for **Richard Duane Kindler** and **GitDigital LLC**. It defines the legal, financial, and risk-based parameters for private lending, liquidity provision, and digital asset management.

By bridging the gap between traditional corporate governance and decentralized finance (DeFi), this repository ensures that every transaction is backed by a documented framework, a clear risk profile, and a transparent audit trail.

---

## 🛠 Repository Structure

| Folder / File | Purpose | Key Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `docs/compliance-framework.md` | **Legal Guardrails** | KYC/AML standards and identity verification. |
| `docs/risk-profile.md` | **Financial Strategy** | Defines risk tiers (1-3) and exposure limits. |
| `docs/tax-governance.md` | **Fiscal Integrity** | Manages interest rates (AFR) and IRS reporting. |
| `schemas/lending-authority.json` | **Machine Readable** | Programmable JSON for integration with on-chain apps. |
| `DISCLAIMER.md` | **Liability Protection** | Defines the scope and limits of the authority. |

---

## ⚖️ Governance Principles

### 1. The Root of Truth
All lending capacity and permissions are defined in `schemas/lending-authority.json`. This file acts as the primary oracle for any automated systems querying Richard's lending capacity.

### 2. Risk Mitigation
We employ a tiered risk strategy to protect the liquidity of the GitDigital ecosystem. No single transaction may exceed **20%** of total authority capacity without a manual override and secondary audit.

### 3. Tax & Audit Readiness
Every transfer of value is governed by the **Arms-Length Principle**. We maintain a strict separation between personal and corporate assets, ensuring all interest earned is documented for Form 1099-INT reporting.

## 🚀 Integration
If you are a developer or auditor within the GitDigital ecosystem, you can fetch the current lending limits programmatically:

```bash
curl -s [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RickCreator87/richards-credit-authority/main/schemas/lending-authority.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RickCreator87/richards-credit-authority/main/schemas/lending-authority.json) | jq .lending_framework

# Colorado State Tax Obligations for Richard Lending Activities

## Income Tax
- Colorado flat income tax rate: 4.4% (2026)
- Interest income taxable as ordinary income
- File Colorado Form 104

## Documentation
- Maintain copies of all federal filings
- Colorado requires conformity with federal tax treatment
- No separate 1099 filing required (follows federal)

## 2026 Estimated Payments
- Quarterly estimated tax payments required if:
  - Expected tax due > $1,000
  - Less than 90% withheld or paid timely
- 2026 Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, 2026; January 15, 2027

## Penalties

- Late payment: 1% per month
- Underpayment of estimated tax: interest charges

## Special Considerations
- Colorado does not tax municipal bond interest
- Private loans are fully taxable

📊 Usage Examples

Create and Validate an Identity

```bash
# Create an identity file
cp templates/identity-example.yaml my-identity.yaml
# Edit with your information

# Validate the identity
python cli.py validate my-identity.yaml

# Process into authority
python cli.py process --type individual my-identity.yaml
```




Programmatic Usage

```python
from validation.validate_identity import IdentityValidator
from governance.engine import GovernanceEngine

# Validate identity
validator = IdentityValidator()
identity_data = {...}  # Your identity data
result = validator.validate(identity_data)

if result["valid"]:
    # Apply governance rules
    engine = GovernanceEngine()
    authority_request = {...}  # Your authority request
    decision = engine.evaluate_authority_request(authority_request, identity_data)
    
    if decision.decision == "approved":
        print("Authority can be granted!")
```


Tax Calculations

```python
from tax.federal.rules import FederalTaxRules
from tax.state.colorado.rules import ColoradoTaxRules

# Calculate federal tax
federal_rules = FederalTaxRules()
tax_result = federal_rules.calculate_income_tax(75000, "single", 2024)

# Calculate state tax
co_rules = ColoradoTaxRules()
state_tax = co_rules.calculate_income_tax(75000, "single", 2024)

print(f"Total tax liability: ${tax_result['total_tax'] + state_tax['tax_amount']:.2f}")
```

def test_feature_under_normal_conditions():
    """Test feature works under normal conditions."""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert
